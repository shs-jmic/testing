BriteCo,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>
• Introduced second company with Hanover as their underwriter.
• This is a broad market play and does NOT require a BriteCo appraisal in the process, however it does require an appraisal within the last 3 years.
• Portions of our PA product - very segmented – Used JM Specialty as their base includes Credit in rating.
• Very similar quote flow as JM - like their breakdown of payments as a monthly option. Looks to be geared for a mobile phone application.
• BriteCo is receiving tiered commissions from Hanover
- 50% up to $2M then drops to 20—25%
- Profit sharing once program reaches $12M with a target of 50% LR - pays up to 2.5% more in commission
• No Call Center - All questions via email/chat.
• Claim over 2100+ jewelers in appraisal software<a href=""https://brite.co/"">BriteCo Website</a></p>"

Photography / Video Service - Zing Studio,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>
Situation: 
There is a great deal of enthusiasm around Zing Studio from JCK. All types of Retail Jewelry Ecosystem have recognized the superior output of Zing Studios. We are in the process of securing clients like Facets of Fire, RDI Diamonds and will continue to enroll as many customers as possible. We are at a pivotal moment, as quality imagery is critical for B2B as tradeshow costs and travel become more expensive to attend in person.
<br></br>
Obstacles: What, if any obstacles, challenges have you faced or are facing?
1)	Customers expect to download their photos and videos all in one spot when they log into Zing (Much like iCloud and Google Photos). 
2)	Single threaded Human Resources – will slow throughput as they are trained. 
3)	We are at a single point of failure for our Specialized cameras and computers.
<br></br>
Actions: What actions have you or your team taken?  
The development team is working to automate processes to mitigate  risks inherent to manual processes.
<br></br>
Results: We are beginning to add clients such as Erica Courtney & Kimberly Collins (President of AGTA).

<strong>Situation: </strong>
Lightspeed POS is one of the only currently viable omni-channel POS solutions after purchasing Shopkeep POS system for legacy system jewelers in 2021. Lightspeed is one of the most advanced threats to our POS strategy if we do not partner with them.
<br></br>
<strong>Obstacles: </strong> Lightspeed is moving quickly, and has deep pockets which they use to keep making investing in acquisition and partnerships. They currently work with BriteCo, and surely have been approached by Zillion. 
<br></br>
<strong>Actions: </strong> Even with other POS partners who might be more suited to execution of our strategy we need to keep pursuing integrations and partnership with Lightpeed.
<br></br>
<strong>Results: </strong>Jeweler Programs should look to lock up a partnership in 2022, to at least have a seat at the table with our competition

<strong>Obstacles: </strong> eBay and other auction services are pushing to win this space (especially in the pre-owned watch market).
<br></br>
<strong>Actions: </strong> A MVP auction capability is being built for ZTS marketplace. It will be stood up in the 3rd quarter, and we will assess how to proceed after seeing results. We are working with Auction Ninja and BlackRock estate sales software.

<strong>Results: </strong>We don’t have live auctions yet but are confident that we will gain traction. Auction Ninja has over 250K repeat registered user visitors per month who are already interested in auction and estate sales, so a significant user base already exists <br></br>

<strong>Situation: </strong>The Diamond Price List is a Diamond Price Comparison tool built by the same group that stood up Get-Diamonds in 2021 on the “Lucy Platform”. It shows a listing of diamond pricing from different marketplaces – Something that Zing could just as easily do. It is another attack on Rapaport’s diamond pricing after Martin sunk 30% plus of value of diamonds in the early days of covid in 2020.
<br></br>
<strong>Obstacles: </strong> Resources - This functionality would need to get prioritized for the ZTS Marketplace roadmap. 
<br></br>
<strong>Actions: </strong> Actively Trailing Get-Diamonds and now the Diamond Price List. Not terribly concerned about DPL, as it is just another function of Get-Diamonds. Website is poorly constructed and attention to detail is lacing. Screens appear to be Photoshoped.
<br></br>
<strong>Results: </strong>As we continue to add vendors and retailers to Marketplace we could bring more transparent functionality of showing what items actually sell for vs. just scraping what diamonds are listed at (and not necessarily sold for).
